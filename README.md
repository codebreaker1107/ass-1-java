What is compiler?
The compiler is a computer program that reads a program written in a high-level language and converts it to machine code or a lower-level language. In simple terms, a compiler is a program that translates human-readable source code into the language (low-level or machine code) understandable by the computer's processor (ie, binary 1 and 0 bits). It also reports errors found in the program. The computer further processes the machine codes to perform the specified tasks.

What is interpreter?
An interpreter is a computer program that performs the same functions as the compiler, but instead of converting an entire program at once, the interpreter converts each high-level program statement into machine code one by one. This includes the source codes of a high-level language, pre-compiled codes as well as script

Compiler vs Interpreter:Key Differences
⦁	The compiler takes a program written in a high-level programming language and translates it into machine code at once, while an interpreter translates the program statement by statement.
⦁	A compiler is relatively faster as it takes the entire program at one go. Besides, an interpreter compiles one line of code at a time. Interpreters take the next line of code only when the previous one has compiled.
⦁	The compiler creates an intermediate code or target code, whereas in the case of an interpreter no intermediate code is generated.
⦁	Because the compiler generates intermediate object code, this requires more memory. Interpreters, on the other hand, do not generate any intermediate object code that makes it memory resourceful.
⦁	In the case of the compiler, errors are displayed only when the entire compilation has been done. Whereas, the interpreter displays the errors of each statement one by one, making it easier to detect errors.
⦁	In a compiler, it is a two-step process because the source code is first translated into the target program (target code or intermediate code) and then executed. Whereas in the interpreter, it is a one-step process where the source code is compiled and executed at the same time.
